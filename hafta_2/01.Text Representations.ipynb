    "## NLP'de Metin Temsili Yöntemleri\n",
    "\n",
    "Doğal Dil İşleme (NLP) alanında metin temsili, metin verisinin makine öğrenmesi ve derin öğrenme algoritmaları tarafından işlenebilmesi için sayısal vektörlere dönüştürülmesidir. Metin temsili, modelin metindeki anlamsal ve yapısal bilgiyi öğrenebilmesi açısından kritik öneme sahiptir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temel Metin Temsili Yöntemleri\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Her bir kelimenin metinde kaç kez geçtiğini sayan, sıklık tabanlı ve bağlamdan bağımsız bir yöntemdir. Basit ve hızlıdır, ancak kelime sırasını ve anlamsal ilişkileri göz ardı eder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Kelimelerin metin içerisindeki önemini belirlemek için kullanılır. Sık geçen ama az belgede bulunan kelimelere daha yüksek ağırlık verir. BoW'a göre daha anlamlı temsiller sunar.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Word Embeddings (Kelime Gömme Yöntemleri)**:\n",
    "   - **Word2Vec**: Kelimeleri, bağlamlarına göre düşük boyutlu yoğun vektörler olarak temsil eder. Anlamsal benzerlikleri yakalayabilir.\n",
    "   - **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**: Kelimeler arası istatistiksel ilişkileri kullanarak vektörler oluşturur. Büyük veri kümelerinde başarılıdır.\n",
    "   - **FastText**: Kelimeleri karakter n-gram’larına böler, böylece bilinmeyen kelimeler için de vektör üretebilir.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cümle ve Paragraf Temsilleri**:\n",
    "   - **Doc2Vec**: Paragrafları veya belgeleri vektörlere dönüştürür.\n",
    "   - **Sentence Embeddings**: Universal Sentence Encoder, Sentence-BERT gibi modellerle cümle düzeyinde temsiller elde edilir.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bağlamsal (Contextual) Temsiller**:\n",
    "   - **Transformer Tabanlı Modeller (BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, vb.)**: Kelimeleri, bulundukları bağlama göre dinamik olarak vektörleştirir. Anlamsal ve bağlamsal ilişkileri güçlü şekilde yakalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sonuç\n",
    "Metin temsili yönteminin seçimi, kullanılacak modelin türüne, veri setinin büyüklüğüne ve çözülmek istenen probleme göre değişir. Modern NLP uygulamalarında bağlamsal ve gömme tabanlı temsiller, klasik yöntemlere göre çok daha başarılı sonuçlar vermektedir."

    "### 1. Bag of Words (BoW) Yöntemi\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of Words (BoW)**, metin verisini sayısal vektörlere dönüştürmek için kullanılan en temel ve yaygın yöntemlerden biridir. Bu yöntemde, bir metindeki her kelimenin kaç kez geçtiği dikkate alınır ve kelime sırası veya bağlamı göz ardı edilir.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Çalışma Prensibi\n",
    "- Öncelikle, tüm metinlerde geçen benzersiz kelimelerden oluşan bir \"kelime sözlüğü\" (vocabulary) oluşturulur.\n",
    "- Her bir metin, bu sözlükteki kelimelerin metinde kaç kez geçtiğini gösteren bir vektör ile temsil edilir.\n",
    "- Sonuç olarak, her metin için uzunluğu sözlükteki kelime sayısı kadar olan bir sayısal vektör elde edilir.\n",
    "- BoW yöntemi, kelime sırasını ve grameri dikkate almaz; yalnızca kelime sıklıklarına odaklanır.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avantajları:**\n",
    "- Basit ve hızlıdır.\n",
    "- Küçük ve orta ölçekli veri setlerinde etkili olabilir.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dezavantajları:**\n",
    "- Kelime sırası ve anlamsal ilişkiler kaybolur.\n",
    "- Büyük veri setlerinde vektörler çok boyutlu ve seyrek (sparse) hale gelir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bir sonraki adımda, BoW yönteminin Python ile nasıl uygulanacağını göstereceğiz."

    "## TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF, Doğal Dil İşleme (NLP) alanında metin verilerini analiz etmek ve önemli kelimeleri belirlemek için kullanılan güçlü bir yöntemdir. Bu yöntem, bir kelimenin bir belgede ne kadar önemli olduğunu hesaplar. Kelimenin sıklığı (TF) ve nadirliği (IDF) dikkate alınarak yapılır. Hiç matematik bilmeyen biri bile anlayacak şekilde adım adım açıklayalım.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temel Kavramlar\n",
    "- **Belge (Document)**: Bir metin parçası, örneğin bir makale, yorum veya kitap bölümü.\n",
    "- **Kelime (Term)**: Metindeki tek tek kelimeler.\n",
    "- **Korpus (Corpus)**: Tüm belgelerin topluluğu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF (Term Frequency) - Kelime Sıklığı\n",
    "TF, bir kelimenin belirli bir belgede ne kadar sık geçtiğini ölçer. Basitçe, \"Bu kelime bu belgede kaç kez var?\" sorusuna cevap verir.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formül:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "TF(t, d) = (t kelimesinin d belgesindeki sayısı) / (d belgesindeki toplam kelime sayısı)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Örnek:**\n",
    "Diyelim ki bir belgede 100 kelime var ve \"köpek\" kelimesi 5 kez geçiyor.\n",
    "- TF(\"köpek\", belge) = 5 / 100 = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Bu, \"köpek\" kelimesinin belgenin %5'ini oluşturduğunu gösterir. Eğer kelime çok sık geçerse TF yüksek olur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) - Ters Belge Sıklığı\n",
    "IDF, bir kelimenin tüm korpusta ne kadar nadir olduğunu ölçer. Yaygın kelimeler (örneğin \"ve\", \"bir\") düşük IDF'ye sahip olurken, nadir kelimeler yüksek IDF'ye sahip olur.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formül:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "IDF(t) = log(N / DF(t))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- N: Toplam belge sayısı.\n",
    "- DF(t): t kelimesini içeren belge sayısı.\n",
    "- log: Logaritma fonksiyonu (basitçe, sayıları küçültmek için kullanılır).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Örnek:**\n",
    "Diyelim ki toplam 1000 belge var ve \"köpek\" kelimesi 10 belgede geçiyor.\n",
    "- DF(\"köpek\") = 10\n",
    "- IDF(\"köpek\") = log(1000 / 10) = log(100) ≈ 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Eğer kelime çok nadir ise (örneğin sadece 1 belgede geçiyor), IDF yüksek olur: log(1000 / 1) = log(1000) ≈ 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF Hesaplaması\n",
    "TF-IDF, TF ve IDF'nin çarpımıdır. Bu, bir kelimenin belgede önemli olup olmadığını belirler:\n",
    "- Yüksek TF: Kelime belgede sık geçiyor.\n",
    "- Yüksek IDF: Kelime nadir, yani özel.\n",
    "- Yüksek TF-IDF: Kelime hem sık hem de nadir, yani önemli!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formül:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) * IDF(t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Örnek:**\n",
    "Yukarıdaki örnekte:\n",
    "- TF(\"köpek\", belge) = 0.05\n",
    "- IDF(\"köpek\") = 2\n",
    "- TF-IDF(\"köpek\", belge) = 0.05 * 2 = 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Bu değer, kelimenin önemini gösterir. Daha yüksek değer, daha önemli kelime demektir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Çalışma Mantığı Adım Adım\n",
    "1. **Veri Hazırlığı:** Tüm belgeleri topla ve kelimelere ayır.\n",
    "2. **TF Hesapla:** Her kelime için her belgede TF'yi hesapla.\n",
    "3. **IDF Hesapla:** Her kelime için IDF'yi hesapla.\n",
    "4. **TF-IDF Hesapla:** TF ve IDF'yi çarp.\n",
    "5. **Önem Sıralaması:** Yüksek TF-IDF'li kelimeler en önemli olanlardır.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basit Analoji:**\n",
    "Düşün ki bir kitap koleksiyonun var. \"Köpek\" kelimesi bir kitapta sık geçiyor ama diğer kitaplarda nadir. Bu, \"köpek\" kelimesinin o kitap için önemli olduğunu gösterir. Ama \"ve\" kelimesi her kitapta sık geçiyor, yani önemli değil.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avantajlar\n",
    "- Yaygın kelimeleri (stop words) önemsiz kılar.\n",
    "- Nadir ama önemli kelimeleri öne çıkarır.\n",
    "- Arama motorları ve metin sınıflandırma için mükemmeldir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dezavantajlar\n",
    "- Büyük veri setlerinde hesaplama maliyeti yüksek olabilir.\n",
    "- Kelime sırası ve bağlamı dikkate almaz (BoW gibi).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bu yöntem, metin madenciliği ve NLP'de temel bir araçtır. Daha gelişmiş modeller (örneğin BERT) için de temel oluşturur."

    "## N-Gram Yöntemi\n",
    "\n",
    "N-Gram, Doğal Dil İşleme (NLP) alanında metin verilerini analiz etmek ve anlamlı kelime gruplarını yakalamak için kullanılan bir yöntemdir. Bu yöntem, metindeki kelimelerin veya karakterlerin ardışık gruplarını (n-gram'lar) oluşturarak bağlamı ve anlamı daha iyi yakalar. N-Gramlar, BoW veya TF-IDF gibi yöntemlerle birlikte kullanılarak metin temsillerini zenginleştirir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temel Kavramlar\n",
    "- **N-Gram**: Metindeki ardışık n adet kelime veya karakter grubu.\n",
    "- **Unigram (1-Gram)**: Tek kelime (örneğin, \"merhaba\").\n",
    "- **Bigram (2-Gram)**: İki ardışık kelime (örneğin, \"merhaba dünya\").\n",
    "- **Trigram (3-Gram)**: Üç ardışık kelime (örneğin, \"merhaba dünya nasılsın\").\n",
    "- **Korpus (Corpus)**: Tüm metinlerin topluluğu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Çalışma Prensibi\n",
    "1. **Metni Hazırla:** Metni kelimelere ayır (tokenization).\n",
    "2. **N-Gram Oluştur:** Ardışık n adet kelimeyi gruplandır.\n",
    "3. **Frekans Hesapla:** Her n-gram'ın kaç kez geçtiğini say.\n",
    "4. **Temsil Et:** N-gram'ları vektör olarak kullan (örneğin, BoW benzeri).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Örnek:**\n",
    "Metin: \"Doğal dil işleme çok eğlenceli\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unigram: [\"Doğal\", \"dil\", \"işleme\", \"çok\", \"eğlenceli\"]\n",
    "- Bigram: [\"Doğal dil\", \"dil işleme\", \"işleme çok\", \"çok eğlenceli\"]\n",
    "- Trigram: [\"Doğal dil işleme\", \"dil işleme çok\", \"işleme çok eğlenceli\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avantajlar\n",
    "- Kelime sırasını ve bağlamı yakalar (BoW'dan daha iyi).\n",
    "- Anlamlı ifadeleri (örneğin, \"yapay zeka\") tespit eder.\n",
    "- Metin sınıflandırma ve dil modeli oluşturmada kullanılır.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dezavantajlar\n",
    "- Büyük n değerleri için vektör boyutu artar (seyrek matris).\n",
    "- Nadir n-gram'lar için overfitting riski.\n",
    "- Hesaplama maliyeti yüksek olabilir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kullanım Alanları\n",
    "- Metin sınıflandırma (sentiment analysis).\n",
    "- Dil modeli oluşturma (örneğin, GPT modelleri).\n",
    "- Yazım düzeltme ve öneri sistemleri.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bu yöntem, NLP'de temel bir araçtır ve modern modellerde (örneğin, BERT) n-gram benzeri yapılar kullanılır."
